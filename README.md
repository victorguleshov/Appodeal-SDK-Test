Use Unity v2022.3.42f1 or newer. Create a repo on GitHub and commit solutions for each task separately. Share the link to the repo, and the updated .unitypackage file once you are done.

Tasks:

1 After installation of the attached Unity plugin, you will face a bug. Some *Dependencies.xml files won’t be installed. Try to fix this behavior.

2 Update the EDM plugin to the latest version.

3 For the iOS platform, refactor the AppodealValidateInAppPurchase method, by replacing primitive method params with a single struct. Make sure to test the project on a simulator or real device.

4 For the Android platform implement the GetBuildDate method. First, you may need to build and decompile the .apk file to see the method signature in com.appodeal.ads.Appodeal class.

5 Update our demo scene and script to display the current plugin and SDK versions at the very bottom of the screen. For the Android platform also add the build date. Make screenshots for both platforms and add them to the repo.

6 Implement Privacy manifest support for iOS (using Unity’s recommended approach)
